# AnonymZ.io

Welcome to AnonymZ.io, a service dedicated to anonymizing links for various services. Our goal is to enhance privacy and security by masking the source of web traffic and acting as a referrer, ensuring a safer online environment for users.

## Overview

AnonymZ.io provides a crucial layer of security in today's digital landscape. By anonymizing links and functioning as a referrer, we protect the privacy of users and prevent the tracking of web traffic sources. This service is essential for maintaining the confidentiality of online activities, especially for services that handle sensitive information.

## How to Use

To use AnonymZ.io as a link anonymizer or referrer:

1. For link anonymization, simply input the URL you wish to anonymize, and the service will generate a new, obscured link.
2. To use as a referrer link, append your original URL to `https://anonymz.io/?` in your application. This will anonymize the traffic source and use AnonymZ.io as the referrer.

Example for using as a referrer link:
```
https://anonymz.io/?https://google.ca
```
